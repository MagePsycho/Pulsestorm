Repository of Magento Tools from Pulse Storm LLC
==================================================	

This repository is the former home of open source code modules and scripts to help developers work more efficiently with the Magento online retail system.  As of Summer 2013, these modules have been moved into individual repositories, listed below.

If you've found any of these projects useful you may find Pulse Storm's commercial extensions and knowledge products useful as well

In addition to the new repository links, if you need the exact snapshot of the repository directly before this change, you can find it in the `pre_reorg` branch.  We'll also keep the `_trash` folder for a few months.
